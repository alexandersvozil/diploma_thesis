This section is a summary of ~\cite[p. 4-7]{BuilAranda20131}. In order to get a
deeper understanding of the SERVICE operator it is mandatory to understand which
problems occur when evaluating the SERVICE operator.
The goal of the semantic definition of the SERVICE operator is to provide an
unambiguous way to evaluate a SPARQL pattern containing SERVICE. A direct
implementation of the SERVICE operator based of the semantics is not feasible 
because we would need to evaluate, given, for example $(\mbox{SERVICE }  x \
P_1)$ where $P_1$ is any SPARQL graph pattern, $P_1$ over every 
possible SPARQL endpoint. This is obviously impossible. To ensure that $P_1$
only gets evaluated over a finite set of IRIs, $x$ needs to be bound to exactly
those. In the W3C standard only indications are provided on how to evaluate the
service operator~\cite{w3standardservice} when the location is a variable and
not an URI. In~\cite{BuilAranda20131} the authors deal with this issue by
providing a notion of boundedness. In order to demonstrate how one could
evaluate a service operator using a variable to evaluate a query over more than
one destination the following example is given:
\begin{example}[\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
Let $G$ be an RDF graph that uses triples of the form\\ $(a, service\_address,b)$
with the intention to express that $b$ is a SPARQL endpoint URI with name $a$.
Then we consider the following query $P$ over the graph $G$ in the dataset $DS$:
\begin{align*}
	P=((x, service\_address, y) \AND (\mbox{SERVICE } y \ (z_n,email,z_e)))
\end{align*}
It is easy to se that $P$ is used to compute the list of names and email
addresses that can be retrieved from the SPARQL endpoints stored in the RDF
graph $G$ through the $service\_address$ triple. 
The whole point of this example is to point out that there is a simple practical
way to evaluate $P$ over $G$ that is also feasible:
By evaluating $\ll (x,service\_address,y) \rr^{DS}_G$ first and then for every
mapping $\mu$ in this set we further evaluate $\ll (\mbox{SERVICE } a \ (z_n, email, z_e)
\rr^{DS}_G$, where $a = \mu(y)$. 
\end{example}

\noindent This example leads to a natural definition of boundedness which relies
on the definition of a domain of a graph, a dataset and a graph pattern.

\begin{definition}[Domain of a graph, a dataset and a graph pattern,\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
    The domain of a graph $G$ denoted $dom(G)$ is defined as $dom(G) = \bigcup\limits_{(u,v,w) \in G}
    vars(u,v,w)$. The domain of a dataset $DS$, denoted $dom(DS)$ is defined as
    $dom(DS) = \bigcup\limits_{G \in names(DS)} dom(G)$.
    The domain of a graph pattern $P$ is denoted $dom(P)$ and refers to the set of URIs that are
mentioned in $P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Boundedness,\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
Let $P$ be a graph pattern and $x \in var(P)$. Then $x$ is bound in $P$ if the
following condition holds:
For every dataset $DS$, every graph $G$ in $DS$ 
and every $\mu \in \ll P \rr^{DS}_G:$\\
\[ x \in dom(\mu) \mbox{ and } \mu(x) \in (dom(DS) \cup names(DS) \cup dom(P)). \]
\end{definition}

\noindent We notice that this definition also makes sure that every location 
variable of a $GRAPH$
operator to be bound because $\mu(x) \in names(DS)$ counts as a bound variable.
Resulting from this definition a very natural way seems to arise to ensure that
a graph pattern $P$ can be evaluated in practice: 
Assuming we want to evaluate a sub-pattern $(\mbox{SERVICE } x \ P_1)$ of $P$
we require $x$ to be bound in $P$. We can then define the problem for deciding if a variable
is bound in a graph pattern $P$:

\begin{framed}\noindent \textbf{BOUND IN PATTERN}\\
	\textbf{INPUT:} A graph pattern $P$ and a variable $x \in var(P)$.\\
	\textbf{QUESTION:} Is $x$ bound in $P$?
\end{framed}
Unfortunately \textbf{BOUND IN PATTERN} is undecidable which can be shown by
reducing from \textbf{SPARQL SAT} to \textbf{BOUND IN PATTERN}.
\begin{framed}\noindent \textbf{SPARQL SAT}\\
	\textbf{INPUT:} A graph pattern $P$.\\
	\textbf{QUESTION:} Does a dataset $DS$ and a graph $G$ in $DS$ exist such
	that $\ll P \rr^{DS}_G$?
\end{framed}
It is a well known result that $\textbf{SPARQL SAT}$ is undecidable~\cite{angles2008expressive}.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
	\textbf{BOUND IN PATTERN} is undecidable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By providing a reduction from the \textbf{SPARQL SAT} problem to the
\textbf{VARIABLE BOUND IN PATTERN} Problem we will be able to show the previous theorem.
Let $P$ be a graph pattern, i.e., an arbitrary instance of \textbf{SPARQL SAT} and
$x,y,z$ variables not mentioned in $P$. Then define the graph pattern $Q$,
i.e. the instance of \textbf{VARIABLE BOUND IN GRAPH} pattern as follows: $Q =
((x,y,z) \UNION  P)$ and take $x$ to be the distinguished variable.
It remains to show that $x$ is bound in $Q$  if and only if $P$ is not
satisfiable.\\
$(\Rightarrow)$:\\
Assume now that the variable $x$ is bound in $Q$, i.e., for every RDF graph $G$
in $DS$ and every $\mu \in \ll Q \rr^{DS}_G:$ $x \in dom(\mu)$ and $\mu(x) \in
(dom(DS) \cup names(DS) \cup dom(P))$. We can instantly see that $x \in
dom(\mu)$ must hold. And because by construction $P$ doesn't contain $x$, $\ll Q
\rr^{DS}_G$ does not contain a mapping that satisfies $P$.
\noindent$(\Leftarrow)$:\\
Assume now that $P$ is satisfiable, i.e., there exists a dataset $DS$ and an RDF
graph $G$ in $DS$ such that $\ll P \rr^{DS}_G \neq \emptyset$. Because 
$\ll P \rr^{DS}_G \neq \emptyset$ we have that $\mu \in \ll P \rr^{DS}_G$. But
$x \notin dom(\mu)$ by the definition of $P$ and thus $x$ cannot be bound in
$P$ and we are done.
\end{proof} 

As deciding boundedness for a variable is undecidable the definition of
\emph{strong boundedness} is introduced, which is a syntactic condition and
efficiently verifiable. 

\begin{definition}[Strong Boundedness~\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
Let $P$ be a graph pattern. Then the set of strongly bound variables in $P$,
denoted by $SB(P)$, is recursively defined as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item if $P =t$, where $t$ is a triple pattern, then $SB(P) = var(t)$;
\item if $P = (P_1 \ AND \ P_2)$, then $SB(P) = SB(P_1) \cup SB(P_2)$ 
\item if $P = (P_1  \ UNION \ P_2)$, then $SB(P) = SB(P_1) \cap SB(P_2)$ 
\item if $P = (P_1 \ OPT \ P_2)$, then $SB(P) = SB(P_1)$ 
\item if $P = (GRAPH \ c \ P_1)$, with $c \in U\cup V$, 
then\\
\begin{align*}
	SB(P) = 
\begin{cases} 
    \emptyset & \mbox{$c \in U$} \\
    SB(P_1) \cup c &\mbox{$c \in V$} 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\item if $P = (SERVICE \ c \ P_1)$, with $c \in U \cup V$, then $SB(P) = \emptyset$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

It is a simple observation that this recursive definition collects a set of
variables that are guaranteed to be bound in $P$. The following proposition
documents this observation.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{BuilAranda20131}]\label{sbinb}
For every graph pattern $P$ and a variable $x \in var(P)$, if $x \in SB(P)$,
then $x$ is bound in $P$.
\end{proposition}
The proof is a very straight forward induction and can be found
in~\cite[Appendix A]{BuilAranda20131}.

We notice that this proposition is not an if and only if statement and hence we may be
able to provide a pattern $P$ where variables $x \in vars(P)$ exist, which are bound but not
strongly bound. Furthermore another example is provided which makes things more
complicated. The previous definition of boundedness is not enough to describe
all the patterns which are feasible to compute. 

\begin{example}
Consider the following graph pattern:
\begin{align*}
P_1 = [(x,service\_description,z) \UNION ((x,service\_address, y) \AND
\\\
(\mbox{SERVICE } y \ (x_n,email,x_e)))]
\end{align*}
$x$ and $z$ store the name of a SPARQL endpoint and a description of its
functionalities through the $service\_description$ triple. $x$ and $y$ store the
name of a SPARQL endpoint and the URI where it is located through the
service\_address triple. The problem is, that variable $y$ is neither bound nor
strongly bound in $P_1$. However we can still easily evaluate the pattern by
assuming a dataset $DS$ and an RDF graph $G$ in $DS$:\\
Compute $\ll (x, service\_description,z)\rr^{DS}_G$, then compute \\
$\ll (x, service\_addres,y) \rr^{DS}_G$ and finally for every
$\mu \in \ll (x, service\_addres,y) \rr^{DS}_G$, compute $\ll (\mbox{SERVICE }
a \ (x_n,email,x_e))\rr^{DS}_G$ with $a = \mu(y)$. We can easily see that $y$ is
bound and strongly bound in the subpattern \\ $((x,service\_address, y) \AND
(\mbox{SERVICE } y \ (x_n,email,x_e)))$ of $P_1$ and thus the evaluation is possible.
\end{example}

\noindent To describe a condition that ensures all SPARQL queries containing the SERVICE
operator can be evaluated in practice, the definition of Service-Boundedness is
introduced.  

\begin{definition}[Parse Tree, \cite{BuilAranda20131}]
	A parse tree of a graph pattern $P$, $\T(P)$ is a tree where each
	node is a sub-pattern of $P$. Each node has an identifier.
\end{definition}

Using the definition of a Parse Tree, Service-Boundedness can be defined.

\begin{definition}[\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
	A graph pattern $P$ is service-bound if for every node $u$ of $\T(P)$ with
	label $(SERVICE \ x\  P_1)$, it holds that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item there exists a node $v$ of $\T(P)$ with label $P_2$ such that $v$
			is an ancestor of $u$ in $\T(P)$ and $x$ is bound in $P_2$.
		\item $P_1$ is service-bound.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Corresponding to this definition we will introduce the \textbf{SERVICE BOUND}
problem:
\begin{framed}\noindent \textbf{SERVICE BOUND}\\
	\textbf{INPUT:} A graph pattern $P$.\\
	\textbf{QUESTION:} Is $P$ service-bound?
\end{framed}

Intuitively one can already imagine that deciding the \textbf{SERVICE BOUND}
problem is undecidable because we use boundedness in it.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
	\textbf{SERVICE BOUND} is undecidable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By providing a reduction from the \textbf{SPARQL SAT} problem to the  
\textbf{SERVICE BOUND} problem we will be able to show undecidability.
Let $P$ be a graph pattern, i.e., an arbitrary instance of \textbf{SPARQL SAT} and
$x,y,z,u,v,w$ variables not mentioned in $P$.
Also assume that $P$ does not mention the operator SERVICE which is not required
to make the SPARQL satisfiability problem undecidable.
Then define the graph pattern $Q$, i.e., the instance of \textbf{SERVICE BOUND} as: 
\begin{align*}
	Q = (((x,y,z) \UNION  P) \AND (\mbox{SERVICE } x \ (u, v, w))).
\end{align*}

\noindent It remains to show that $Q$ is service-bound if and only if $P$ is not
satisfiable.

\bigskip\noindent
$(\Leftarrow)$ \quad If $P$ is not satisfiable, then $Q$ is equivalent to the
pattern: 
\begin{align*}
	Q' = ((x,y,z)) \AND (\mbox{SERVICE} \ x \ (u, v, w)).
\end{align*} 
But $Q'$ is service bound because $x$ is bound in $Q'$: Assume an
arbitrary dataset $DS$, let $G$ be in $DS$. Then 
for any $\mu \in \ll Q' \rr^{DS}_G$, $x \in dom(\mu)$ and for sure $\mu(x) \in
(dom(DS) \cup names(DS) \cup dom(P))$ by semantics of SPARQL and the fact that
$x$ occurs in the triple pattern $(x,y,z)$.


\bigskip\noindent
$(\Rightarrow)$\quad Assume that $P$ is satisfiable. Then we know that variable
$x \not\in vars(P)$ and thus we have that $x$ is not a bound variable in $Q$,
and thus because $x$ occurs in a service operator, $Q$ is not service bound.


\end{proof}

We then use the syntactic condition, i.e., strong boundedness to define
service-safeness.

\begin{definition}[Service Safeness~\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
	A graph pattern $P$ is service-safe if for every node $u$ of $\T(P)$ with
	label $(SERVICE \ x \ P_1)$ it holds that:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item there exists a node $v$ of $\T(P)$ with label $P_2$ such that $v$
			is an ancestor of $u$ in $\T(P)$ and $x \in SB(P_2)$.
		\item $P_1$ is service safe.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

As corollary to Proposition 1, the following proposition is obtained:
\begin{proposition}[\cite{BuilAranda20131}]
	If a graph pattern $P$ is service-safe, then $P$ is service-bound.
\end{proposition}

It remains to find out the difference between strong boundedness
and boundedness. Because boundedness $\not \Leftrightarrow$ strong-boundedness, there
must be patterns which are bounded but not strongly bounded. These patterns are at least
of theoretical interest and could harm the decidable procedure:
Assume a pattern is bounded but not strongly bounded. Then it is feasible to be evaluated, 
but the proposed algorithm returns that it is not.

\begin{example}\label{bbutnotsbound}
	\begin{align*}
		P = (x,a, b) \OPT (x, a, y).
	\end{align*}
	$y$ is obviously bound in $P$ because for every RDF graph $G$ in $DS$ and
	every $\mu \in \ll P \rr^{DS}_G$ we have that $y \in dom(\mu)$ and
	$\mu(y) \in (dom(DS))$ but $SB = \{ x \}$.
\end{example}

Example~\ref{bbutnotsbound} shows that there patterns 
which are bound but not strongly bound.
Consider now service safeness, boundness and the following pattern:
\begin{align*}
	P = (((x,a, b) \ OPT \ (x, a, y)) \  AND \ (SERVICE \ y \  (a,b,w)))
\end{align*}
Pattern $P$ is service-bound but not service-safe. It is obviously possible to
evaluate $P$. Looking at these examples and noticing that $P$ is contained in
the query 
\begin{align*}
	Q = ((x,a, y) \  AND \ (SERVICE \ y \ (a,b,w)))
\end{align*} which is obviously service-safe, one could propose that for every
service-bound query, there is a service-safe query where the service-bound query
is contained in the service-safe query and also the other way round. For our
examples this would mean $P \equiv Q$, where $P$ is service-bound but not
service-safe and $Q$ is service-bound and service-safe.

\begin{theorem}\label{ezprop}
	The problem of verifying, given a graph pattern $P$ and a variable $x \in
	var(P)$, whether $x$ is bound in $P$ is as hard as deciding $(P_1 \AND 
	P_2)
	\equiv (P_1 \OPT P_2)$ for every subpattern $(P_1 \OPT  P_2)$ of $P$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	It is very easy to decide strong boundedness and Proposition~\ref{sbinb}
	shows that if a variable $x$ is in $SB(P)$ then $x$ is also bound in $P$.
	We thus modify our pattern $P$ in such a way, that $SB(P)$ collects all the
	variables which are bound, even those which are only bound but not strongly
	bound.
	Assume $x$ is bound in $P$ and $x \notin SB(P)$.
	There must thus be a subpattern $Q$ where $x$ gets lost in the recursive
	approach.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $Q$ is a triple $t$ then $SB(Q) = var(t)$ and thus $x \in SB(Q)$.
		\item If $Q$ is $(P_1 \AND   P_2)$ then $SB(Q) = SB(P_1) \cup SB(P_2)$
			and $x \in SB(Q)$ because $SB(Q) = SB(P_1) \cup SB(P_2)$.
		\item If Q is $(P_1 \UNION  P_2)$ then $SB(P) = SB(P_1) \cap SB(P_2)$ thus
			w.l.o.g. $x$ can get lost if $x \in SB(P_1)$ but $x \notin
			SB(P_2)$. But this cannot cause conflicts because then we could
			easily construct a DS with a graph $G$ in it s.t. $\mu \in \ll P_2
			\rr^{DS}_G$, but then $\mu$ does not contain $x$ so we are done
			because $(P_1  \UNION  P_2)$ cannot cause $Q$ to be bound but not
			strongly bound.
		\item If $Q$ is $(P_1 \OPT  P_2)$ we have by definition of SB that $SB(P) = SB(P_1)$
			So a variable $x$ gets lost if it is in $SB(P_2)$, but not in
			$SB(P_1)$. When we have the case that $x$ is bound in $Q$ but not
			strongly bound in $Q$ we must thus have $(P_1 \AND  P_2) \equiv
			(P_1 \OPT  P_2)$ for every DS, Graph and $\mu \in \ll Q
			\rr^{DS}_G$.
			Note that deciding $(P_1 \AND P_2) \equiv
			(P_1 \OPT  P_2)$ is undecidable for general SPARQL patterns and causes deciding
			boundedness to be undecidable. Furthermore it is the key to explain
			the difference between strongly boundedness and boundedness.
		\item If $Q$ is $(\mbox{GRAPH } c \ P_1)$ it is obvious that no variables get lost
			in $SB(Q)$.
		\item if $P = (\mbox{SERVICE }  c \ P_1)$ is is also obvious that no variables are
			lost in the procedure.
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
	The problem of verifying, given a graph pattern $P$, whether $P$ is
	service-bound is as hard as deciding $(P_1 \AND \ P_2)
	\equiv (P_1 \OPT  P_2)$ for every subpattern $(P_1 \OPT P_2)$ of $P$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	It is obvious that checking the boundedness in the ancestor of a service
	node causes the undecidability. Thus we use the result in Lemma~\ref{ezprop} to
	show that deciding whether a variable $x$ is bound in this ancestor is as
	hard as deciding $(P_1 \AND P_2)
	\equiv (P_1 \OPT  P_2)$ for every subpattern $(P_1 \OPT P_2)$ of $P$, where
	$P$ is the label of the ancestor node.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
	The problem of verifying, given a well-designed graph pattern $P$, whether $P$ is
	service-bound is NP-hard.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Hier sind auch meine results wichtig weil $P_1$ und $P_2$ wiederum SERVICE
	und GRAPH beinhalten koennten. Sonst ist natuerlich
	$\cite{pichler2014containment}$ zu zitieren.
